        <h2>Company History</h2>
        <p>Elev8 Bicycles is a business section of Tek Experts. Our owners have been single speed enthusiasts for many years and have considerable experience in building and repairing bikes. We are authentic cycling enthusiasts and we want our customers to know that when they buy from us, they are buying from experienced and passionate people.</p>
        <p>Elev8 grew out of the need of our sister company, Tek Experts, to transform the way they skilled and upskilled their technical support engineers. From our beginnings as Tek Academy, we became elev8 and expanded our digital skilling programs across the YNV Group of companies and externally to help enterprises and governments from around the world transform their digital skilling programs.</p>

       <h3> The ABC Bike Check: Air, Brakes, Chain</h3>

        A is for Air: Properly inflated tires helps prevent flats. With the palm of you hands, push down on the top of the tire to check that they’re aired-up and ready to go. It should feel firm. If you’re unsure, attach a bike pump to check the pressure. You can find the recommended tire pressure (PSI) on the sidewall of the tire. While you’re checking the air, take the opportunity to ensure your quick-release levers and thru axles (if you have them) are properly tightened as well.
B is for Brakes: Squeeze your front and rear brake levers to make sure that the brakes engage properly and smoothly; they shouldn't pull all the way to the grips. Test the braking action on the front and rear brakes independently to make sure they’re gripping well. Also inspect your brake pads for 
C is for Chain: Look at your chain and all the gears. Grab a pedal and start turning it backwards to make sure the chain runs smoothly through the cassette and derailleur; lubricate the chain if necessary (read how to clean and lube your chain below). Also, grab each of the crank arms and try to give them a wiggle to check that they’re not loose.
